Creation of the .ova file for system deployment

To begin, create a VM using a Windows 10 ISO. Begin with standard default installation.

You will now need to enable scripts in order to run the following script to remove bloatware.
To do so, open PowerShell with administrative privelages.
Type command "get-executionpolicy" and hit enter
Then, "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" and enter "y"
This has now enabled scripts.
